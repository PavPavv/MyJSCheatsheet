const bigStr = `I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that Iwon’t bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up andmy feeling that everything was dead. With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life youcould  call  my  life  on  the  road.  Before  that  I’d  often  dreamed  of  going  West  to  see  the  country,always  vaguely  planning  and  never  taking  off.  Dean  is  the  perfect  guy  for  the  road  because  heactually  was  born  on  the  road,  when  his  parents  were  passing  through  Salt  Lake  City  in  1926,  in  ajalopy,  on  their  way  to  Los  Angeles.  First  reports  of  him  came  to  me  through  Chad  King,  who’dshown  me  a  few  letters  from  him  written  in  a  New  Mexico  reform  school.  I  was  tremendouslyinterested  in  the  letters  because  they  so  naively  and  sweetly  asked  Chad  to  teach  him  all  aboutNietzsche  and  all  the  wonderful  intellectual  things  that  Chad  knew.  At  one  point  Carlo  and  I  talkedabout  the  letters  and  wondered  if  we  would  ever  meet  the  strange  Dean  Moriarty.  This  is  all  farback,  when  Dean  was  not  the  way  he  is  today,  when  he  was  a  young  jailkid  shrouded  in  mystery.Then  news  came  that  Dean  was  out  of  reform  school  and  was  coming  to  New  York  for  the  firsttime; also there was talk that he had just married a girl called Marylou.One day I was hanging around the campus and Chad and Tim Gray told me Dean was staying ina  cold-water  pad  in  East  Harlem,  the  Spanish  Harlem.  Dean  had  arrived  the  night  before,  the  firsttime  in  New  York,  with  his  beautiful  little  sharp  chick  Marylou;  they  got  off  the  Greyhound  bus  at50th Street and cut around the corner looking for a place to eat and went right in Hector’s, and sincethen Hector’s cafeteria has always been a big symbol of New York for Dean. They spent money onbeautiful big glazed cakes and creampuffs.All  this  time  Dean  was  telling  Marylou  things  like  this:  «Now,  darling,  here  we  are  in  New  Yorkand although I haven’t quite told you everything that I was thinking about when we crossed Missouriand especially at the point when we passed the Booneville reformatory which reminded me of my jailproblem, it is absolutely necessary now to postpone all those leftover things concerning our personallovethings and at once begin thinking of specific worklife plans . . .» and so on in the way that he hadin those early days.I went to the cold-water flat with the boys, and Dean came to the door in his shorts. Marylou wasjumping  off  the  couch;  Dean  had  dispatched  the  occupant  of  the  apartment  to  the  kitchen,  probablyto make coffee, while he proceeded with his loveproblems, for to him sex was the one and only holyand  important  thing  in  life,  although  he  had  to  sweat  and  curse  to  make  a  living  and  so  on.  You  sawthat  in  the  way  he  stood  bobbing  his  head,  always  looking  down,  nodding,  like  a  young  boxer  toinstructions,  to  make  you  think  he  was  listening  to  every  word,  throwing  in  a  thousand  «Yeses»  and«That’s  rights.»  My  first  impression  of  Dean  was  of  a  young  Gene  Autry-trim,  thin-hipped,  blue-eyed,  with  a  real  Oklahoma  accent  -  a  sideburned  hero  of  the  snowy  West.  In  fact  he’d  just  beenworking  on  a  ranch,  Ed  Wall’s  in  Colorado,  before  marrying  Marylou  and  coming  East.  Marylouwas  a  pretty  blonde  with  immense  ringlets  of  hair  like  a  sea  of  golden  tresses;  she  sat  there  on  theedge of the couch with her hands hanging in her lap and her smoky blue country eyes fixed in a widestare because she was in an evil gray New York pad that she’d heard about back West, and waitinglike  a  longbodied  emaciated  Modigliani  surrealist  woman  in  a  serious  room.  But,  outside  of  being  asweet  little  girl,  she  was  awfully  dumb  and  capable  of  doing  horrible  things.  That  night  we  all  drankbeer and pulled wrists and talked till dawn, and in the morning, while we sat around dumbly smokingbutts from ashtrays in the gray light of a gloomy day, Dean got up nervously, paced around, thinking,and  decided  the  thing  to  do  was  to  have  Marylou  make  breakfast  and  sweep  the  floor.  «In  other words we’ve got to get on the ball, darling, what I’m saying, otherwise it’ll be fluctuating and lack oftrue knowledge or crystallization of our plans.» Then I went away.During the following week he confided in Chad King that he absolutely had to learn how to writefrom  him;  Chad  said  I  was  a  writer  and  he  should  come  to  me  for  advice.  Meanwhile  Dean  hadgotten a job in a parking lot, had a fight with Marylou in their Hoboken apartment - God knows whythey  went  there  -  and  she  was  so  mad  and  so  down  deep  vindictive  that  she  reported  to  the  policesome  false  trumped-up  hysterical  crazy  charge,  and  Dean  had  to  lam  from  Hoboken.  So  he  had  noplace  to  live.  He  came  right  out  to  Paterson,  New  Jersey,  where  I  was  living  with  my  aunt,  and  onenight  while  I  was  studying  there  was  a  knock  on  the  door,  and  there  was  Dean,  bowing,  shufflingobsequiously  in  the  dark  of  the  hall,  and  saying,  «Hello,  you  remember  me  -  Dean  Moriarty?  I’vecome to ask you to show me how to write.»«And where’s Marylou?» I asked, and Dean said she’d apparently whored a few dollars togetherand gone back to Denver - »the whore!» So we went out to have a few beers because we couldn’ttalk  like  we  wanted  to  talk  in  front  of  my  aunt,  who  sat  in  the  living  room  reading  her  paper.  Shetook one look at Dean and decided that he was a madman.In  the  bar  I  told  Dean,  «Hell,  man,  I  know  very  well  you  didn’t  come  to  me  only  to  want  tobecome a writer, and after all what do I really know about it except you’ve got to stick to it with theenergy of a benny addict.» And he said, «Yes, of course, I know exactly what you mean and in factall  those  problems  have  occurred  to  me,  but  the  thing  that  I  want  is  the  realization  of  those  factorsthat  should  one  depend  on  Schopenhauer’s  dichotomy  for  any  inwardly  realized  .  .  .»  and  so  on  inthat  way,  things  I  understood  not  a  bit  and  he  himself  didn’t.  In  those  days  he  really  didn’t  knowwhat  he  was  talking  about;  that  is  to  say,  he  was  a  young  jailkid  all  hung-up  on  the  wonderfulpossibilities of becoming a real intellectual, and he liked to talk in the tone and using the words, but ina  jumbled  way,  that  he  had  heard  from  «real  intellectuals»  -  although,  mind  you,  he  wasn’t  so  naiveas  that  in  all  other  things,  and  it  took  him  just  a  few  months  with  Carlo  Marx  to  become  completelyin  there  with  all  the  terms"ababazzzz"  and  jargon.  Nonetheless  we  understood  each  other  on  other  levels  ofmadness, and I agreed that he could stay at my house till he found a job and furthermore we agreedto go out West sometime. That was the winter of 1947.One night when Dean ate supper at my house - he already had the parking-lot job in New York -he leaned over my shoulder as I typed rapidly away and said, «Come on man, those girls won’t wait,make it fast.»I  said,  «Hold  on  just  a  minute,  I’ll  be  right  with  you  soon  as  I  finish  this  chapter,»  and  it  was  oneof  the  best  chapters  in  the  book.  Then  I  dressed  and  off  we  flew  to  New  York  to  meet  some  girls.As  we  rode  in  the  bus  in  the  weird  phosphorescent  void  of  the  Lincoln  Tunnel  we  leaned  on  eachother  with  fingers  waving  and  yelled  and  talked  excitedly,  and  I  was  beginning  to  get  the  bug  likeDean. He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con-man, he wasonly  conning  because  he  wanted  so  much  to  live  and  to  get  involved  with  people  who  wouldotherwise pay no attention to him. He was conning me and I knew it (for room and board and «how-to-write,»  etc.),  and  he  knew  I  knew  (this  has  been  the  basis  of  our  relationship),  but  I  didn’t  careand  we  got  along  fine  -  no  pestering,  no  catering;  we  tiptoed  around  each  other  like  heartbreakingnew friends. I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me. As far as my workwas concerned he said, «Go ahead, everything you do is great.» He watched over my shoulder as Iwrote  stories,  yelling,  «Yes!  That’s  right!  Wow!  Man!»  and  «Phew!»  and  wiped  his  face  with  hishandkerchief.  «Man,  wow,  there’s  so  many  things  to  do,  so  many  things  to  write!  How  to  evenbegin to get it all down and without modified restraints and all hung-up on like literary inhibitions andgrammatical fears . . .»
«That’s  right,  man,  now  you’re  talking.»  And  a  kind  of  holy  lightning  I  saw  flashing  from  hisexcitement  and  his  visions,  which  he  described  so  torrentially  that  people  in  buses  looked  around  tosee the «overexcited nut.» In the West he’d spent a third of his time in the poolhall, a third in jail, anda  third  in  the  public  library.  They’d  seen  him  rushing  eagerly  down  the  winter  streets,  bareheaded,carrying books to the poolhall, or climbing trees to get into the attics of buddies where he spent daysreading or hiding from the law.We  went  to  New  York  -  I  forget  what  the  situation  was,  two  colored  girls  -  there  were  no  girlsthere;  they  were  supposed  to  meet  him  in  a  diner  and  didn’t  show  up.  We  went  to  his  parking  lotwhere he had a few things to do - change his clothes in the shack in back and spruce up a bit in frontof a cracked mirror and so on, and then we took off. And that was the night Dean met Carlo Marx.A tremendous thing happened when Dean met Carlo Marx. Two keen minds that they are, they tookto each other at the drop of a hat. Two piercing eyes glanced into two piercing eyes - the holy con-man with the shining mind, and the sorrowful poetic con-man with the dark mind that is Carlo Marx.From that moment on I saw very little of Dean, and I was a little sorry too. Their energies met head-on, I was a lout compared, I couldn’t keep up with them.The  whole  mad  swirl  of  everything  that  was  to  come  began  then;  it  would  mix  up  all  my  friendsand all I had left of my family in a big dust cloud over the American Night. Carlo told him of Old BullLee,  Elmer  Hassel,  Jane:  Lee  in  Texas  growing  weed,  Hassel  on  Riker’s  Island,  Jane  wandering  onTimes Square in a benzedrine hallucination, with her baby girl in her arms and ending up in Bellevue.And  Dean  told  Carlo  of  unknown  people  in  the  West  like  Tommy  Snark,  the  clubfooted  poolhallrotation  shark  and  cardplayer  and  queer  saint.  He  told  him  of  Roy  Johnson,  Big  Ed  Dunkel,  hisboyhood  buddies,  his  street  buddies,  his  innumerable  girls  and  sex-parties  and  pornographicpictures,  his  heroes,  heroines,  adventures.  They  rushed  down  the  street  together,  digging  everythingin  the  early  way  they  had,  which  later  became  so  much  sadder  and  perceptive  and  blank.  But  thenthey  danced  down  the  streets  like  dingledodies,  and  I  shambled  after  as  I’ve  been  doing  all  my  lifeafter  people  who  interest  me,  because  the  only  people  for  me  are  the  mad  ones,  the  ones  who  aremad  to  live,  mad  to  talk,  mad  to  be  saved,  desirous  of  everything  at  the  same  time,  the  ones  whonever  yawn  or  say  a  commonplace  thing,  but  burn,  burn,  burn  like  fabulous  yellow  roman  candlesexploding  like  spiders  across  the  stars  and  in  the  middle  you  see  the  blue  centerlight  pop  andeverybody  goes  «Awww!»  What  did  they  call  such  young  people  in  Goethe’s  Germany?  Wantingdearly to learn how to write like Carlo, the first thing you know, Dean was attacking him with a greatamorous  soul  such  as  only  a  con-man  can  have.  «Now,  Carlo,  let  me  speak  -  here’s  what  I’msaying ...» I didn’t see them for about two weeks, during which time they cemented their relationshipto fiendish allday-allnight-talk proportions.Then  came  spring,  the  great  time  of  traveling,  and  everybody  in  the  scattered  gang  was  gettingready to take one trip or another. I was busily at work on my novel and when I carne to the halfwaymark, after a trip down South with my aunt to visit my brother Rocco, I got ready to travel West forthe very first time.Dean  had  already  left.  Carlo  and  I  saw  him  off  at  the  34th  Street  Greyhound  station.  Upstairsthey had a place where you could make pictures for a quarter. Carlo took off his glasses and lookedsinister.  Dean  made  a  profile  shot  and  looked  coyly  around.  I  took  a  straight  picture  that  made  melook  like  a  thirty-year-old  Italian  who’d  kill  anybody  who  said  anything  against  his  mother.  Thispicture  Carlo  and  Dean  neatly  cut  down  the  middle  with  a  razor  and  saved  a  half  each  in  theirwallets. Dean was wearing a real Western business suit for his big trip back to Denver; he’d finishedhis  first  fling  in  New  York.  I  say  fling,  but  he  only  worked  like  a  dog  in  parking  lots.  The  mostfantastic parking-lot attendant in the world, he can back a car forty miles an hour into a tight squeeze
and stop at the wall, jump out, race among fenders, leap into another car, circle it fifty miles an hourin  a  narrow  space,  back  swiftly  into  tight  spot,  hump,  snap  the  car  with  the  emergency  so  that  yousee  it  bounce  as  he  flies  out;  then  clear  to  the  ticket  shack,  sprinting  like  a  track  star,  hand  a  ticket,leap into a newly arrived car before the owner’s half out, leap literally under him as he steps out, startthe  car  with  the  door  flapping,  and  roar  off  to  the  next  available  spot,  arc,  pop  in,  brake,  out,  run;working  like  that  without  pause  eight  hours  a  night,  evening  rush  hours  and  after-theater  rush  hours,in greasy wino pants with a frayed fur-lined jacket and beat shoes that flap. Now he’d bought a newsuit  to  go  back  in;  blue  with  pencil  stripes,  vest  and  all  -  eleven  dollars  on  Third  Avenue,  with  awatch  and  watch  chain,  and  a  portable  typewriter  with  which  he  was  going  to  start  writing  in  aDenver rooming house as soon as he got a job there. We had a farewell meal of franks and beans ina  Seventh  Avenue  Riker’s,  and  then  Dean  got  on  the  bus  that  said  Chicago  and  roared  off  into  thenight.  There  went  our  wrangler.  I  promised  myself  to  go  the  same  way  when  spring  really  bloomedand opened up the land.And  this  was  really  the  way  that  my  whole  road  experience  began,  and  the  things  that  were  tocome are too fantastic not to tell.Yes,  and  it  wasn’t  only  because  I  was  a  writer  and  needed  new  experiences  that  I  wanted  toknow Dean more, and because my life hanging around the campus had reached the completion of itscycle  and  was  stultified,  but  because,  somehow,  in  spite  of  our  difference  in  character,  he  remindedme  of  some  long-lost  brother;  the  sight  of  his  suffering  bony  face  with  the  long  sideburns  and  hisstraining  muscular  sweating  neck  made  me  remember  my  boyhood  in  those  dye-dumps  and  swim-holes and riversides of Paterson and the Passaic. His dirty workclothes clung to him so gracefully, asthough  you  couldn’t  buy  a  better  fit  from  a  custom  tailor  but  only  earn  it  from  the  Natural  Tailor  ofNatural Joy, as Dean had, in his stresses. And in his excited way of speaking I heard again the voicesof  old  companions  and  brothers  under  the  bridge,  among  the  motorcycles,  along  the  wash-linedneighborhood  and  drowsy  doorsteps  of  afternoon  where  boys  played  guitars  while  their  olderbrothers worked in the mills. All my other current friends were «intellectuals» - Chad the Nietzscheananthropologist, Carlo Marx and his nutty surrealist low-voiced serious staring talk, Old Bull Lee andhis critical anti-every-thing drawl - or else they were slinking criminals like Elmer Hassel, with that hipsneer; Jane Lee the same, sprawled on the Oriental cover of her couch, sniffing at the New Yorker.But  Dean’s  intelligence  was  every  bit  as  formal  and  shining  and  complete,  without  the  tediousintellectualness.  And  his  «criminality»  was  not  something  that  sulked  and  sneered;  it  was  a  wild  yea-saying overburst of American joy; it was Western, the west wind, an ode from the Plains, somethingnew,  long  prophesied,  long  a-coming  (he  only  stole  cars  for  joy  rides).  Besides,  all  my  New  Yorkfriends were in the negative, nightmare position of putting down society and giving their tired bookishor political or psychoanalytical reasons, but Dean just raced in society, eager for bread and love; hedidn’t  care  one  way  or  the  other,  «so  long’s  I  can  get  that  lil  ole  gal  with  that  lil  sumpin  down  theretween her legs, boy,» and «so long’s we can eat, son, y’ear me? I’m hungry, I’m starving, let’s eatright now!»  -  and  off  we’d  rush  to  eat,  whereof,  as  saith  Ecclesiastes,  «It  is  your  portion  under  thesun.»A  western  kinsman  of  the  sun,  Dean.  Although  my  aunt  warned  me  that  he  would  get  me  introuble, I could hear a new call and see a new horizon, and believe it at my young age; and a little bitof trouble or even Dean’s eventual rejection of me as a buddy, putting me down, as he would later,on starving sidewalks and sickbeds - what did it matter? I was a young writer and I wanted to takeoff.Somewhere  along  the  line  I  knew  there’d  be  girls,  visions,  everything;  somewhere  along  the  line the pearl would be handed to me.`;
